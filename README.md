# Testing Branch
The main purpose of this branch is to provide a functional version of .zshrc that uses thefuck plugin. 
Requires python3.11 and still returns slowly, could be worth investigating the [experimental turbo mode](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck?tab=readme-ov-file#experimental-instant-mode).
